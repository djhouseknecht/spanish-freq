  <p>
    There are many sources that compile the most frequently used words in the Spanish language. Lists like this are
    helpful
    for people who are learning Spanish to know which words are the most crucial to learn and understand first. The
    purpose
    of this application is to aggregate that data into a clean format for people to quickly look through. The main
    advantage
    purpose is to aggregate the <strong>Lemma</strong> of the most commonly used words (mainly the verbs).
  </p>

  <h3>What is a Lemma?</h3>
  <p>
    According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemma_(morphology)" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia.org:</a>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    In morphology and lexicography, a <strong>lemma</strong> (plural lemmas or lemmata) is the canonical form,
    dictionary form, or
    citation form of a set of words (headword).
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Most specifically in Spanish there are many verb congujations that share the same lemma. For example,
    <strong>está, estoy, & estaba</strong> all have the same lemma, <strong>estar</strong>.
    This aggregated data can be useful to those learning Spanish to see which verbs and conjugation tenses are most used
    in Spanish.
